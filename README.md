# tauri-build-action

Adds more format support for Windows

## Usage

As opposed to the offical
[tauri-action](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-action) this action is as
minimal as possible. Instead of creating a GitHub release and uploading
artifacts all-in-one, it provides outputs to conveniently compose together with
other actions such as `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/download-artifact` or
`softprops/action-gh-release`.

This action needs both Node.JS and Cargo to be already setup.

### Minimal

The following example workflow builds artifacts on all 3 supported platforms
(Window, macOS and Linux).

```yaml
name: 'publish'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build-binaries:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: install Rust stable
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable

      - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
        if: matrix.platform == 'ubuntu-latest'
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev webkit2gtk-4.0 libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf

      - uses: zoy-l/tauri-build-action@v1
        id: tauri_build

    # You can now use the JSON array of artifacts under `steps.tauri_build.outputs.artifacts` to post-process/upload your bundles
```

### Bundling the app and creating a release

Chances are you want to do _something_ with the artifacts that you produced. The
following action will produce artifacts for Windows, macOS and Linux upload them
as workflow artifacts, so that a final job (called `publish`) can create a
GitHub release and attach all prouced artifacts to it. This would also be the
place where you could upload artifacts to an AWS Bucket or similar.

```yaml
name: 'publish'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build-binaries:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [macos-latest, ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: install Rust stable
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable

      - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
        if: matrix.platform == 'ubuntu-latest'
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev webkit2gtk-4.0 libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf

      - uses: zoy-l/tauri-build-action@v1
        id: tauri_build

      # The `artifacts` output can now be used by a different action to upload the artifacts
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: artifacts
          path:
            "${{ join(fromJSON(steps.tauri_build.outputs.artifacts), '\n') }}"

  publish:
    needs: build-binaries
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Download the previously uploaded artifacts
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
        id: download
        with:
          name: artifacts
          path: artifacts
      # And create a release with the artifacts attached
      - name: 'create release'
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@master
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: '${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}'
        with:
          draft: false
          files: ./artifacts/**/*
```

### Building for Apple Silicon

This example workflow will run produce binaries for Apple Silicon (aarch64) as
well as the previously shown 3 platforms. This leverages the build matrix. This
can be expanded to produce binaries for other target combinations too.

```yaml
name: 'publish'

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  build-binaries:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform:
          - os: ubuntu-latest
            rust_target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
          - os: macos-latest
            rust_target: x86_64-apple-darwin
          - os: macos-latest
            rust_target: aarch64-apple-darwin
          - os: windows-latest
            rust_target: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform.os }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: 'Setup Rust'
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          default: true
          override: true
          profile: minimal
          toolchain: stable
          target: ${{ matrix.platform.rust_target }}

      - uses: Swatinem/rust-cache@v2

      - name: install dependencies (ubuntu only)
        if: matrix.platform.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
        run: |
          sudo apt-get update
          sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev webkit2gtk-4.0 libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf
